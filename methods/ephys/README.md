# Electrophysiology Methods

Analysis methods for neural recordings.

## Categories

- **Spike Sorting**: Kilosort, MountainSort, SpykingCircus
- **LFP Analysis**: Power spectra, coherence, phase-amplitude coupling
- **Single Unit**: Firing rates, tuning curves, place cells
- **Population**: Dimensionality reduction, decoding, neural trajectories

## Common Pipelines

### Spike Sorting
1. Preprocessing (filtering, referencing)
2. Spike detection
3. Clustering
4. Manual curation (Phy)
5. Quality metrics

### LFP Analysis
1. Downsampling and filtering
2. Artifact rejection
3. Time-frequency decomposition
4. Cross-region analysis

## Adding Methods

Include preprocessing steps, analysis parameters, and validation approaches.
